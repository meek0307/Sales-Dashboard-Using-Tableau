### Project Overview
The Sales Dashboard utilizes Tableau's advanced features to connect to relevant data sources, transform and manipulate the data, and create insightful visualizations. By leveraging the capabilities of Tableau, this project enables users to gain valuable insights into sales performance, trends, and patterns.

In addition, Python is used to generate dummy data for the purpose of demonstration. The generated data mimics real-world sales information and serves as a foundation for populating the sales dashboard. Python's flexibility and ease of use make it an ideal choice for generating and manipulating data.

### Key Features
- Interactive Visualizations: The sales dashboard offers interactive visualizations that allow users to explore sales data from different perspectives and drill down into specific details.
- Sales Performance Metrics: The dashboard showcases key sales performance metrics such as profit, sales, andnumber of customers acquisition, providing a comprehensive overview of sales performance.
- Dynamic Filtering: Users can apply filters to the dashboard to analyze sales data based on specific criteria, such as product subcategory, or region, enabling deeper insights and analysis.
- Trend Analysis: The dashboard includes visualizations that highlight sales trends over region, identifying patterns in sales performance.
- Data Generation: Python scripts are used to generate dummy sales data, providing a realistic dataset to populate the dashboard and simulate real-world scenarios.
